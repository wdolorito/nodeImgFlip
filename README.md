- 'doge' site icon from https://icons8.com/
- API is the public https://api.imgflip.com

## Briefly

- "Meme"able images found from ImgFlip site and cached.
- Form will take input from user to label meme.
- Meme shows up after pressing __CREATE__ with link to copy/paste and image.
- Profit!!!!

## A little longer...
IDs and images to be meme'd are cached for 6 minutes using `node-cache`.  Created memes are cached for 2 minutes.  API calls are made on the server using `socketio` with `qs` helping out.  The form has a radio button to enable saving to an ImgFlip account if desired.  At the very bottom of the page, a modal dialog opens to send a short message using `gmail-send`.  All of this is dressed up using `Materializecss`, since this one page site wasn't too complicated.

## Configuratoring
The port this app shows up on can be changed in the `port` file.  Visit https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords to create a password to be used with this app, then take that password and create a `gmail-credentials.json` file with the following format:
```sh
{
  "user": "aUser@gmail.com",
  "pass": "abcdefghijklmnop"
}
```
