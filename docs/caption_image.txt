METHOD: POST


KEY             VALUE

template_id     A template ID as returned by the get_memes response. Any ID
                that was ever returned from the get_memes response should work
                for this parameter. For custom template uploads, the template
                ID can be found in the memegenerator URL,
                e.g. https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/14859329/Charlie-Sheen-DERP.
                Also, here is a list of the top 100 Imgflip meme IDs.
username        username of a valid imgflip account. This is used to track
                where API requests are coming from.
password        password for the imgflip account. As always, make sure password
                (and all the other parameters) are in the body of the POST
                request, not in the request url.
text0           Top text for the meme (do not use this parameter if you are
                using the boxes parameter below)
text1           Bottom text for the meme (do not use this parameter if you are
                using the boxes parameter below)
font            [optional] The font family to use for the text. Current options
                are "impact" and "arial". Defaults to impact.
max_font_size   [optional] Maximum font size in pixels. Defaults to 50px.
boxes           [optional] For creating memes with more than two text boxes, or
                for further customization. If boxes is specified, text0 and
                text1 will be ignored, and text will not be automatically
                converted to uppercase, so you'll have to handle capitalization
                yourself if you want the standard uppercase meme text. You may
                specify up to 5 text boxes. All options below are optional,
                except "text". The exception is that you may leave the first
                box completely empty, so that the second box will automatically
                be used for the bottom text.
                x, y, width, and height are for the bounding box of the text
                box. x and y are the coordinates of the top left corner. If you
                specify bounding coordinates, be sure to specify all four (x,
                y, width, height), otherwise your text may not show up
                correctly. If you do not specify bounding box coordinates,
                the same automatic default coordinates from
                imgflip.com/memegenerator will be used, which is very useful
                for memes with special text box positioning other than the
                simple top/bottom.

                Example "boxes" array:

                [
                  {
                    "text": "One does not simply",
                    "x": 10,
                    "y": 10,
                    "width": 548,
                    "height": 100,
                    "color": "#ffffff",
                    "outline_color": "#000000"
                  },
                  {
                    "text": "Make custom memes on the web via imgflip API",
                    "x": 10,
                    "y": 225,
                    "width": 548,
                    "height": 100,
                    "color": "#ffffff",
                    "outline_color": "#000000"
                  }
                ]
